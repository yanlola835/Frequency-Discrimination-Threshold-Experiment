# Frequency-Discrimination-Threshold-Experiment
This project is an experiment designed to test your pitch discrimination skills!

## How the Experiment Works
- Two tones are played on each trial.
- The participant presses **1** or **2** to indicate which tone has the higher frequency.
- If the participant answers **two consecutive trials correctly**, the frequency difference between tones becomes smaller by a square root of 2.
- If the participant answers **one trial incorrectly**, the frequency difference increases by a square root of 2.
- After **four incorrect responses**, the experiment ends.
- A graph is generated showing correct and incorrect trials over time.

## Purpose
This experiment adapts difficulty based on participant performance to measure auditory pitch sensitivity.

## Running the Experiment Locally

This experiment involves audio playback and interactive input, which cannot run directly on GitHub.

To run the experiment:

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Make sure Python is installed (Python 3.8+ recommended)
3. Install required packages (e.g., numpy, matplotlib, sounddevice)
4. Open `Threshold_Experiment.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
5. Run all cells and follow the on-screen instructions

Audio will play through your computer’s speakers.
