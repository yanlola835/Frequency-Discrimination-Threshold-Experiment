# Frequency-Discrimination-Threshold-Experiment
This project is an experiment designed to test pitch discrimination skills.

## How the Experiment Works
- Two tones are played on each trial.
- The participant presses **1** or **2** to indicate which tone has the higher frequency.
- If the participant answers **two consecutive trials correctly**, the frequency difference between tones becomes smaller.
- After **four incorrect responses**, the experiment ends.
- A graph is generated showing correct and incorrect trials over time.

## Purpose
This experiment adapts difficulty based on participant performance to measure auditory pitch sensitivity.
