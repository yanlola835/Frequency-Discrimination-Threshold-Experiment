# Frequency-Discrimination-Threshold-Experiment
An experiment for testing your pitch discrimination skills! 

Two tones are played. Press 1 or 2 to indicate which tone was a higher frequency. The tones become closer in frequency if you get two consecutive trials correct. After 4 errors, the experiment ends and makes a graph of your correct and incorrect trials.
